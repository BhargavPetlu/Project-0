What is a Version Control System (VCS)?
A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps track changes to files, code, and documents over time. It allows multiple users to collaborate, maintain a history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. VCS ensures efficient collaboration, avoids conflicts, and improves software development workflows.

Types of Version Control Systems
1. Local Version Control System
Stores different versions of files on a local machine.
Uses simple file copies or databases to track changes.
Example: RCS (Revision Control System).
Limitations:

No collaboration support.
High risk of data loss if the local machine crashes.
2. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
A single central server contains all versioned files.
Developers pull files from the server and commit changes back.
Examples: SVN (Subversion), CVS (Concurrent Versions System), Perforce.
Advantages:

Easy administration.
Centralized backup and security.
Disadvantages:

Single point of failure.
Performance issues with large teams.
3. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
Every user has a complete copy of the repository.
Changes can be made offline and later synchronized.
Examples: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar.
Advantages:

No single point of failure.
Faster operations and better collaboration.
Branching and merging are easier.
Disadvantages:

Requires more storage on local machines.
